A Twitter like database project - written with node.js in 24Hours

This is Twitter like project mostly written with nodejs in less than 24hours, it has major flaws like not using promises and etc.

just to let you know, I didn't use models because we were not allowed and we must have used raw sql.

the project description and my database **ER Diagram** and **Table Schemas** are added in the root directoy along with an export of my Mysql database structure.

using nodejs was mainly a challenge for myself to figure out my weakness in the enviroment. I will be glad if anybody guides me through learning more and be sure that I'm aware that I'm not complete

If you had any suggestions or complaints about my code feel free to contact me.
